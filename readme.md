# Guitar Depository

## Introduction

This is a fully-functioning RESTful Guitar Storage API written in `node.js`, `express.js` and `mongoose`. The API can perform basic CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE (CRUD) operations and comes with custom built Error Handling out-of-the-box. The API makes use of `mongoose` schemas to enforce rules and validators for client-input.
